It also includes a 🖥️ dedicated desktop application that runs in the background on the student’s system. This app is built to:

📸 Capture real-time screenshots of student screens

🧠 Track active applications and browser usage

⌨️🖱️ Log keyboard and mouse activity during classes or exams

These features help ensure that 👨‍🎓 students stay focused and do not access unauthorized tools like AI bots, Google search, or messaging apps during important sessions.

All captured data—📂 screenshots, ⏱️ activity logs, and access times—are securely stored and made available on the teacher’s dashboard. This allows for effective real-time monitoring, 📊 performance analysis, and helps maintain academic integrity during online learning and examinations. ✅

Let me know if you also want this section included in a README file format (README.md) or as part of a video narration!
